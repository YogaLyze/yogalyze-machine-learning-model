Following details on how to replicate our steps.
## Scraping Data
1. Open [Data](https://github.com/YogaLyze/yogalyze-machine-learning-model/tree/main/Data) Folder.
2. Download the [Yoga-82 Dataset](https://github.com/YogaLyze/yogalyze-machine-learning-model/blob/main/Data/Yoga-82.zip) and [Scaping_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/YogaLyze/yogalyze-machine-learning-model/blob/main/Data/Scraping_Data.ipynb) file for scraping data.
3. Put the .ipynb file and dataset in same folder and run the .ipynb file from start to finish.
4. The Data will be downloaded.

## Train Model 
1. Open [Model](https://github.com/YogaLyze/yogalyze-machine-learning-model/tree/main/Model) Folder and download the [Model.ipynb](https://github.com/YogaLyze/yogalyze-machine-learning-model/blob/main/Model/Model.ipynb) file.
2. Put data that obtained in scraping data process to same folder.
3. Run .ipynb file from start to finish.
4. .h5 model will be downloaded.
